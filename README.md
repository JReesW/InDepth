## A game made for the Pygame Community Spring Game Jam 2025
---

A Shoot 'em Up game with a 3D twist!  
Make your way through 3 levels of tough bullet hell, fighting a plethora of enemy ships along the way.  
Made by **Lowland Palms**

# Info
This game was made for the Pygame Community Spring Game Jam 2025. Our given theme for the jam was ***"Spatial"***, and we were given two weeks the time to complete this. The obvious choice for the theme was to make the game take place in outer space, but as that wouldn't be unique enough we required a mechanic that makes use of mathematical space. To combine these ideas together, we decided to make a Shoot 'em Up similar to Gradius (personally mostly inspired by Platypus) but within a 3D space.

# Installation
Download Python 3.12+ if you haven't already.  
Download the code to your computer.  
Install the required libraries:  
 - `python -m pip install pygame-ce`  
 - `python -m pip install numpy`  

Or install all the packages in one go using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` while located within the game's folder.  
Now simply run `python main.py` from within the game's folder to start playing!

# How to play  
The main menu of the game is navigated using the mouse.  
The controls during gameplay are as follows:
 - `WASD` to move horizontally and vertically
 - `R` to move into the depth (also `I` for two-handed use)
 - `F` to move out of the depth (also `K` for two-handed use)
 - `Space` to shoot (can be held down)
 - `Esc` to pause the game

That about wraps up this readme. There's a good chance we will continue working on this game, in which case a link to the old version will be provided (as it was when submitted to the jam).  
Thanks!
